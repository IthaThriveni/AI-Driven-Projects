        "    - `rotation_range=20`: Randomly rotating images by up to 20 degrees to introduce variety.\n",
        "    - `width_shift_range=0.2` and `height_shift_range=0.2`: Shifting the image horizontally and vertically by up to 20% of the image width or height, respectively.\n",

        "In the heart of our tomato disease detection project lies the neural network model responsible for classifying tomato leaf images. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a powerful choice for image classification tasks, and here, we define our CNN model using the Keras library.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of the code:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `num_classes`: We calculate the number of classes (disease categories) based on the number of classes defined in our training data using `train_generator.class_indices`. This value is essential for configuring the output layer of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `model = Sequential([...])`: We create a sequential model, a linear stack of layers, and define its architecture. Our model consists of the following layers:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - `Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation=\"relu\", input_shape=(224, 224, 3))`: The first convolutional layer with 32 filters of size (3, 3), ReLU activation, and input shape (224, 224, 3). This layer extracts features from input images.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    - `MaxPooling2D(2, 2)`: Max-pooling layer with a 2x2 pooling window. It reduces spatial dimensions and retains important features.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    - `Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation=\"relu\")`: A second convolutional layer with 64 filters and ReLU activation.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    - `MaxPooling2D(2, 2)`: Another max-pooling layer to further reduce spatial dimensions.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    - `Flatten()`: This layer flattens the output from the previous layers into a one-dimensional vector.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    - `Dense(128, activation=\"relu\")`: A fully connected (dense) layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    - `Dropout(0.5)`: Dropout layer with a dropout rate of 50%. Dropout helps prevent overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    - `Dense(num_classes, activation=\"softmax\")`: The final dense layer with `num_classes` neurons (equal to the number of disease categories) and softmax activation. This layer produces class probabilities for each category.\n",
        "\n",
        "This architecture represents a common design for CNNs in image classification tasks. However, you can experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and regularization techniques to fine-tune the model's performance for your specific dataset.\n",
